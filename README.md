# SMOTE data augumentation using logistic regression
This script uses data augumentation to retrain a Logistic regression model to enhance its performance
# Data Preparation
Import necessary libraries and modules.
Load the dataset from the provided URL using Pandas.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets while stratifying based on the target variable to ensure a balanced distribution.
Create a Dataset object from the testing set using the giskard.Dataset class, which helps manage and manipulate data for machine learning tasks.
# Preprocessing
Define the column types for the dataset.
Separate columns to scale and columns to encode based on their types.
Set up transformers for numerical and categorical data preprocessing using Scikit-Learn pipelines.
Create a ColumnTransformer that applies the defined transformers to the appropriate columns.
Create a complete pipeline that includes preprocessing using the ColumnTransformer and a logistic regression classifier.
# Model Training and Evaluation
Fit the pipeline to the training data.
Predict on both the training and testing data.
Print a classification report showing precision, recall, F1-score, and other metrics for model evaluation.
# Model Wrap-up
Wrap the trained pipeline as a Model object from the giskard.Model class.
Validate the wrapped model using the testing set and print a classification report.
# Data Slices Analysis
Perform data slices analysis by calculating performance metrics for each data slice.
Identify underperforming data slices.
Apply preprocessing to underperforming data using the defined preprocessing pipeline.
Use ADASYN or SMOTE to balance classes for the underperforming data.
Apply preprocessing to well-performing data.
# Model Retraining
Create a new logistic regression pipeline for retraining.
Combine the augmented underperforming data with preprocessed well-performing data.
Retrain the logistic regression model on the combined dataset.
Evaluate the retrained model's performance on the test set and print the score and classification report.
# Conclusion
This code demonstrates a complete process of building, evaluating, and retraining a credit scoring classification model. It covers data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and retraining on underperforming data slices.
